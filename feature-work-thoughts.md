Ahh... I'm kind of not feeling it but need to try

- [ ] use video recording with buffer stream
  - [ ] apply variance for auto focus
    - [ ] factor in pre-calibrated distances
      - [ ] check focuses regarding fstop
- [ ] fix audio recording
- [ ] restructure code to factor in voice control
- [ ] test at home for several minutes

I feel like I can take the web stream code apart and pull the buffer part (what I want)

I've seen an example of picamera2 though with video recording where it had a buffer... hopefully it's not just for preview
