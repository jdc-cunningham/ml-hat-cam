I don't know how big something is at some focal length... this lens goes from 8-50mm and my plane is a 1.5m wing span... how high up can I fly it before it's too small/a spec again.

sensor size is 1/2.3"

From counting pixels... I got a magnification of 5.6x... expected with the zoom magnification is 4x
