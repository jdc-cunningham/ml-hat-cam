I need to debug the manual test_stepper.py code because some state is preventing the steppers from moving.

I was trying to zero them manually

Overall I'm still trying to get the steppers to stop moving beyond their max positions and resume from restart/pick up previous positions.

did my shopping gotta put the keycaps back on my keyboard

3:42 PM

got it back together, takes a while to put all the 100+ keys back on

I will say today's a shopping day so I usually binge/get tired af/lazy so I'm not sure what I can do

I haven't eaten anything major yet, but I have been eating random garbage

it's funny I've just started working on this codebase and i'ts already almost unmanageable

4:08 PM

this probably isn't happening, maybe later I'm just chillin at this point scrolling mindlessly

sometimes you gotta turn off
