This is still in progress, I've just been busy with work these last 3 days and today.

I'm mentally spent so can't really dive into this at the moment.

I did receive the parts though, I bought tactile buttons and a larger OLED for the menu interface plus a speaker with a built in amp from Adafruit, that'll be cool... oh and a usb mic... so the RPi can be voice controlled (this stuff is easier just using libraries and stored sounds eg. pygame).

Less foreign to me I mean unlike ML.

It'll be cool to design a GUI menu interface
