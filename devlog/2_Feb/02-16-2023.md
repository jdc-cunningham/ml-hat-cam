going to focus on getting this physical bit designed/printed as by end of Feb/early Mar I have a new toy to mess around with (this one I am not building). Will get lost into that for a bit, make content but this project will otherwise be my main project for spring/summer use.

I want to start recording videos with it and gather data to train the ML model on.

Modeling list

- Pi 4B
- OLED
- dpad board and power sources
- battery set

I'm thinking about prioritizing the battery pack actually since it's pretty easy (copy Twerk Lidar Robot battery case)

I could also start working on the bolt design

Ha here it is, first one, I just picked an area that seemed to make sense/thin material

Used my DMM probe to make the hole/widen it and then just thread the bolt through, don't feel it from inside the hat.

It is a 8-32x1 Nylon Mach Screws with Wing nuts matching size

I do not feel good right now, tired and feeling lazy but I'm going to keep going

I'm glad I'm finally using these... the TLR uses one and it has not ran in a while.

You can see how the cell is too long for these flat cell cases, I have to saw them in half (where is that saw) and then super glue them into the 3D printed case that has the bolt hole mounts.
