11:34 AM

slow start today

I'm going to get the battery status indicator/OLED display thing working

11:46 AM

definitely distracted right now, just scrolling

11:52 AM

After today I'm going to dump time into the monocle so I'll take a break from this

But as it warms up/gets more dry, I'll get back into this and fix my plane

I have to record footage next, so the write video to USB with mixed audio is a good thing to do next

then I'll record a lot of footage to do the training on which I have to figure out, but the AR stuff I'm working on will involve ML so that'll help me

eventually boot.py will be like main.py where it runs everything and it's waiting for user input to start recording

12:00 PM

alright I'll start, I only have 6 hrs left today

12:11 PM

alright start now, headphones on

12:19 PM

I still have to restructure this code, it's still a jumbled up mess at the moment since I don't have the states and functionality completely planned out yet

I'm going to reduce the max uptime too... so I cut it off at 20% left

275 is good... hmm I'll try 300

12:41 PM

there's a problem with the crontab

1:13 PM

something weird is happening the incrementer is working but getter says 0 eg. 100%

1:23 PM

this is so weird... one command calling a get from DB returns value, the other one returns 0

how is that possible? same function

could be cursor instance?

1:46 PM

this is so dumb... I even checked in sqlite cli and the column exists but keeps saying it doesn't

1:57 PM

yeah two different db accesses (same db) have different values

did not help, the select isn't working

2:49 PM

got it was a path issue

now the problem is the top part of the display has to get cleared to cleanly write a new status damn
