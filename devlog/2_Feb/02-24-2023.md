so my nearby/weekend goal is to get this battery tracker thing working

I want a percentage that updates on the top left... lets me know when to charge

then by next week I should have the monocle and will dump time on that for a bit

I'm excited about the thought of filming my plane with this camera though so that will happen

Mixing the audio is cool too, happens automatically on cameras but neat to do in code

6:05 PM

ugh... this is one of those "not sure if good decision" moment

I don't wnat to mix the batt db logic with the stepper db logic (file)

6:26 PM

I got a working battery storage... need the CRON to increment it every 5 mins

then need button tied to menu render

6:45 PM

the update is not working, uptime is always 0 hmm

6:48 PM

had to reset db

so have a tracking battery life, rough estimate now
