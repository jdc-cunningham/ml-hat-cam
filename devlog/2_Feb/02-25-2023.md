new day, going to work on the voice stuff again since it's the hardest between that and menu stuff

11:13 AM

alright let's go... my local goal is to record a video showing the voice-triggered zoom/zoom out with statuses

11:24 AM

alright... made an account with picovoice.ai

it looks like that github repo is literally for the word "porcupine"

so I have to train my own stuff for:

- zoom in
  - responds (middle zoom)
  - responds (max zoom)
  - responds max zoom (does nothing)
- zoom out
  - responds (middle zoom)
  - responds (zoomed out) does nothing if already zoomed out

I only need those two bare minimum

looks like I want speech to intent

Using Rhino, going through their interface

I don't really understand what's happening... it seems to already work

okay so I donwload the modle (cloud icon)

the zoom out one sometimes triggers zoom in... that's not great

I don't see the training part though, it's not like "say it again and again" it just says "click to test"

well whatever let me get the model onto my rpi

11:50 AM

I don't understand why you need a key if it's offline (no internet)

12:06 PM

have an alsa problem

I'm almost tempted to say f it and skip voice control for now and use the buttons to zoom in/out

in the end I want to make my own models but that requires time

12:10 PM

okay... I got it working, had to specify device index

I will try it offline now

the microphone distance is great

the speaker emits this annoying sound sadly

I need to turn it on/off

12:32 PM

so I tried it offline and it does work

I turned the wifi off and used it

the issue is the speaker goes nuts... this whining sound... I have to turn off sound output somehow

I may need like a switch/mosfet type to literally stop the speaker from making noise which sucks because it's unplanned

12:42 PM

still trying to find a way to disable volume

12:48 PM

I'll just run that demo code as a thread with a way to kill it, run while recording video
