9:54 AM

let's goooo I woke up early today

I had to prepare coffe, shower, eat breakfast... all that

ready now

going to attach the electronics to the bottom case, already printing the top case

10:49 AM

I'm working on shortening the wires but the focus stepper isn't working for some reason

has power... correct wires...

10:56 AM

bad power connection, crappy soldering on my aprt

11:10 AM

ehh... I just folded the wires... I don't want to shorten 16 wires+

11:26 AM

I gotta... drawing a blank

I have to model the hook thing still

Oh I need to determine the run time of this thing... I'll just set it on the side somewhere and have it fire a CRON job every 5 minutes/write a log until it dies

Then when it boots the question of "charged" comes up, no... continue counting down from previous battery logs (have to write to DB)

the center of gravity is at the base of the camera roughly it turns out... so I'm designing a "hook" thing with a couple of points for stability

total unit weight is...

15.6 oz (electronics)

4.6oz (batteyr pack)

so together it's under 1.5 lbs

11:32 AM

waiting for the print

11:53 AM

assembled, still need the hanging hook/mount to hat
