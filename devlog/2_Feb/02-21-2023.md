Okay... so I'm standing there (I realize)

No the field...

Look at how sharp this plane is the knife-edge carbon wings

<img src="../images/at-the-field.JPG"/>

Do you see the problem in filming my plane by myself

<img src="../images/too-far-away.JPG"/>

This is what the camera needs to be trained on

<img src="../images/training-example.JPG"/>

So it finds the plane (could be a buzzard) and zooms into it to try and achieve 1/3 frame, meanwhile the autofocus will keep it sharp

I have to take the frame sampling into a thread so it doesn't affect write to USB

Before I get to the ML part, I have to record footage... I have some time before it's flying time... I won't make the mistake again of flying while there's mud on the ground, that's how I broke this plane in half last time I slipped during launch

5:30 PM

ahh... damn sidetracked...

anyway I will get vocal commands working so I can say "zoom in, zoom status" that kind of thing

that'll work for recording the initial footage

I'm going to setup the time tracking/menu thing too since I would rather not kill the hat cam to not stress the batteries

5:39 PM

ahh I'm feeling tired

5:42 PM

what can I do right now that's not that hard?...

database

also a menu splash screen/play the sound

I'll manually generate the audio files for now

I'll set the low battery warning against an uptime of 5.5 hrs

5:49 PM

the term is offline speech to text, looks like Mozilla DeepSpeech is good

I see something for microphone too with alsa

https://www.seeedstudio.com/blog/2020/01/23/offline-speech-recognition-on-raspberry-pi-4-with-respeaker/

built into pip nice

so yeah a nearby goal is to control the steppers with voice eg. "zoom in" "zoom in" "zoom out"

feedback would say "maximum zoom"

6:02 PM

I'm going to screw around with this deepspeech thing

I need to build that db battery tracking thing but ties into menu

I want a splash screen when it boots, little image/logo shows up

oh yeah I need to count the lines from the CRON job though I already know the answer

69 * 5 so 5.75 hrs

6:10 PM

distracted

gotta find the usb mic

looking at this

https://github.com/touchgadget/DeepSpeech

6:22 PM

good link

https://discourse.mozilla.org/t/error-installing-deepspeech-on-raspberry-pi-4/91003/2

damn... my OS/platform is not supported

6:32 PM

trying another one

https://forums.raspberrypi.com/viewtopic.php?t=330490

this stuff is not for money but I see GPL licenses

https://github.com/Uberi/speech_recognition

there is a note about usb mic

device_index=1

ml-hat-cam facing me, it's in slot 1, towards back, non-usb-3

6:42 PM

ooh... this is working... it's dumping a lot of nasty logs but I can thread it and filter out the command

then catch problems

<img src="../images/banana-stt.JPG"/>

6:47 PM

I need to see it's resource usage as it runs as a thread on the side

it can also crash I noticed, this lock thing

6:55 PM

I don't think I was using offline mode in the example

adding pocketsphinx now which is by carnegie mellon nice

6:57 AM

the accuracy is bad

well... this is where I'd train my own model and speak a bunch of times, training it myself would be cool and also only needs to know a few phrases

but this is a good starting point and has to be offline/on the edge

lmao I say banana it says lenin

zoom in = demon

damn

might have to go with vosk

7:07 PM

the bendy mic is not long enough/can't break ambient sound threshold

good thing I bought the wired one

it'll be interesting because I need to record this audio to disk and also use it for STT

it's so bad... maybe it's the mic, need to record audio sample to local

7:17 PM

sound recorded is not terrible

this is not gonna work... sphinx is so bad

trying the small us model

https://alphacephei.com/vosk/models

not sure where to put it

lmao

RTFM

"Vosk thinks you said Vosk thinks you said Please download the model from https://github.com/alphacep/vosk-api/blob/master/doc/models.md and unpack as 'model' in the current folder.`

I downloaded a zipped model, gotta move it in here

/home/pi/ml-hat-cam/code/speech-to-text

I need to not track this... in case any issues idk

this library is not for sale so I think I'm good... it's apache licensed

/home/pi/ml-hat-cam/code/speech-to-text

7:40 PM

man... these are not usable

they are either inaccurate or don't work

the online model works... damn

hmm.... might need an alternative plan here... if voice control doesn't work

I am down to train my own but I have no idea how long that would take to learn

hmm...

I'm going to look into this

https://www.tensorflow.org/tutorials/audio/simple_audio

I just need to train my own commands
