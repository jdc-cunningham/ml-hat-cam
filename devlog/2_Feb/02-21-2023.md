Okay... so I'm standing there (I realize)

No the field...

Look at how sharp this plane is the knife-edge carbon wings

Do you see the problem in filming my plane by myself

<img src="../images/too-far-away.JPG"/>

This is what the camera needs to be trained on

<img src="../images/training-example.JPG"/>

So it finds the plane (could be a buzzard) and zooms into it to try and achieve 1/3 frame, meanwhile the autofocus will keep it sharp

I have to take the frame sampling into a thread so it doesn't affect write to USB

Before I get to the ML part, I have to record footage... I have some time before it's flying time... I won't make the mistake again of flying while there's mud on the ground, that's how I broke this plane in half last time I slipped during launch

5:30 PM

ahh... damn sidetracked...

anyway I will get vocal commands working so I can say "zoom in, zoom status" that kind of thing

that'll work for recording the initial footage

I'm going to setup the time tracking/menu thing too since I would rather not kill the hat cam to not stress the batteries

5:39 PM

ahh I'm feeling tired

5:42 PM

what can I do right now that's not that hard?...

database

also a menu splash screen/play the sound

I'll manually generate the audio files for now

I'll set the low battery warning against an uptime of 5.5 hrs

the term is offline speech to text, looks like Mozilla DeepSpeech is good

I see something for microphone too with alsa

built into pip nice

so yeah a nearby goal is to control the steppers with voice eg. "zoom in" "zoom in" "zoom out"

feedback would say "maximum zoom"

6:02 PM

I'm going to screw around with this deepspeech thing

I need to build that db battery tracking thing but ties into menu

I want a splash screen when it boots, little image/logo shows up

oh yeah I need to count the lines from the CRON job though I already know the answer

69 * 5 so 5.75 hrs

6:10 PM

distracted

gotta find the usb mic
