going to get a CRON job logging up time

still doing some day job work but will get that going

I want to see how it looks while filming/attached to head, will just record web stream output via screen recorder

also I will receive a monocle soon, will dive into that for a bit

but this project is still a main focus for me as spring/summer approaches

5:32 PM

the autofocus algo sucks

it gets in a bad state where it just keeps going back and forward

9:47 PM

I'm still trying to kill the battery just letting it sit

the aiming of the hat cam is good enough/looks where I'm looking

the focusing code needs work

10:53 PM

wow it died... surprising

these are supposedly 3400mAh so 3.4Ah x 2, 7.8Ah... it lasted under 6hrs... so it must draw more than 1amp per hour wow

the OLED was on later... anyway gives me an idea... I'm surprised that's not a long time, enough for a flying session but yeah

I was ssh'd in some too but not the whole time
