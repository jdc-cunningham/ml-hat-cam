I feel like crap today, headache, passed out for half an hour

I came across porcupine/picovoice

I think that approach makes sense eg. wake/intent since I will be recording audio while recording video... and then the voice command fires

I only need like 6 phrases so I can train those myself if needed

I gotta look into it more...

I'm going to work on that boot/battery logging system

It'll be easy, cron-based... will figure out what I did for the pi zero 2 navigation sensor thing
