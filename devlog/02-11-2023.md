another weekend, sleeping in again like a dumbass

so I posted a question about better edge detection for detecting if an image is in focus

they gave me new terms to look into, the first one being laplacian this seems easy to try out (StackOverflow)

https://stackoverflow.com/questions/48319918/whats-the-theory-behind-computing-variance-of-an-image

I am going to speed up the physical development of this device since the software can be polished afterwards.

I just want an easier to grab device than a box of wires and a breadboard

12:28 PM

I do want to design the menu system that doens't use an OS GUI that'll be neat

I wish I had one of those 40pin ribbon cables that'd be nice... but I'll just make one.

12:42 PM

ahh distracted

1:03 PM

it's working but it freezes too

which idk if that's just the delay from wireless

Okay I'm going to try and write a control loop to autozoom

issue is I still don't know the intuitiveness

It's easier if I stick with one ring at a time

1:09 PM

one issue is I'm butchering this code... for the camera

need to use it in a class and import together in main

I also need to do some kind of sliding scale/average so I know if I'm progressively getting better or worse with the zooming and also to stop/at best zoom currently

1:20 PM

distracted but also this is a good challenge, writing an algo

conditions

- near max throw
- getting better or worse
- step size (large or small = finer)

1:40 PM

there's some kind of natural parameter passing thing going on "implicit" no idk the word

by nesting the classes messed it up

1:58 PM

ugh... this pylance thing is not working right, code works but saying import not found

2:19 PM

quick break... still haven't gotten the autozoom loop done, working on making this stream code into a class

then later will try the display out, maybe solder a dpad together to start working with

2:46 PM

back on, I am pumped to make this thing which is good

I am concerned about running out of pins so I need to check that as well because I have the display, then a speaker and 5 buttons... worst case I use an ADC to get 8 pins from 4 or so... but idk that sucks too

3:12 PM

damn I'm still failing to get this code to work

3:30 PM

ehh... I was not able to turn it into a class without something breaking so I just went with hopefully an importable function

4:25 PM

damn I'm slowing down

so now I have a working camera stream that can talk to the steppers

I still need to write to USB eventually

the web stream is nice for me to see what the camera sees in real time

4:29 PM

I'm trying to come up with this algo control loop

you're seeing the values... they either go up or down... if you focus

so you gotta be like "oops... wrong way" and then go backwards since the number went down

but then eventually you gotta just stop.... you found the ideal focus at this zoom

the other thing is which way do you go... for this I was looking at a threshold like if you're near max, or at max... go the other way

it's neutrally zoomed at startup

if you use a moving average or something... how many values do you need, at least 3?

1 isn't enough... how about two?

4:36 PM

I'm losing focus

I think you just need two, you can store one, next value is better or worse... if it gets better good, try to get better, worse, you got your range
