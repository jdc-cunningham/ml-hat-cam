another weekend, sleeping in again like a dumbass

so I posted a question about better edge detection for detecting if an image is in focus

they gave me new terms to look into, the first one being laplacian this seems easy to try out (StackOverflow)

I am going to speed up the physical development of this device since the software can be polished afterwards.

I just want an easier to grab device than a box of wires and a breadboard

I do want to design the menu system that doens't use an OS GUI that'll be neat

I wish I had one of those 40pin ribbon cables that'd be nice... but I'll just make one.
