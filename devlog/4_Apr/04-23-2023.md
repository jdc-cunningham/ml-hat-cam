alright kind of spent already, did some studying

I want to fire this thing up again... a lot of my projects I just set aside and it's like they no longer exist, I feel bad

this thing is rad, it's like a complete system

I'm going to look into the autofocusing code real quick

I forget the ip of this device

oh yeah I should put it on the LCD screen on boot

Charged? lol I remember that, buttons still work nice

damn gonna have to arp scan

4:23 AM

oh might be 104

yeap

dang I feel tired already

oh I can't show the ip address on boot... maybe if it's connected to the web already

4:38 AM

omg... this is so stupid I forgot about this

I write code on my desktop then git pull it into the ml-hat-cam lmao

I did make it where you can write on desktop without ml-hat-cam with mock ups for hardware calls but yeah

4:43 AM

wtf... the ip address is wrong lol

4:49 AM

oh man... this is the worst possible way to get an IP address but since I have 6-7 pi's on the same network the previous way to get ip returns the wrong one
