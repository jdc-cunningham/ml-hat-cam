Damn I let myself sleep in too much on the weekend, I was ready as I am on 9 AM weekdays by 3 PM today lol

- fix the max positions being ignored
- integrate db, use main top level file

last time I worked on this I was trying to store every step of the stepper into sqlite so I don't lose position

but it's pretty nuts since it's storing a step like every 10ms.

so my idea now is to just store the final position assuming it all went through otherwise throw an error flag somewhere that makes the user have to reset it visually

I should have designed in bumpers but I did not think about it at the time

Got my coffee... cherry reds keyboard, 91% isopropyl alcohol to clean it with dove soap for my hands to be grippy and not oily

I'm unfortunately sweating though from the caffeine

I bought the nylon bolts yesterday to mount this system to the hat, has wing nuts, will secure it like loctite with electrical tape

I also got more gold sandisk cards 128GB so I'll start fresh with that

I would like to get the procedural (what?) zooming done where it's analyzing pixels and zooming based on how a human would do it

This is not ML, the ML part of this project is after it's focused, where it detects the plane and then works on keeping it in focus/the right size

3:55 PM

OMG Jacob start!

I'm fk'n scrolling through social media, free yourself boi

4:00 PM

eventually this box of parts will be a fully assembled unit, two parts (electronics/lens and battery on other side connected by power leads)

here are the other parts for the menu interface and voice in/audio out

Ideally I'd use a multiplixer or something to not use pins for 5 buttons but ehh... I have the pins (I think)

Time to power it up

The new SD card does add delay since it's a blank install

4:37 PM

alright almost back to where I was before

I need to re-center it, have the DB store the final positions, add a flag for manual reset

then I need to start extracting frames from video and working on it/seeing how fast I can iterate over pixels and do computations

finally I work on something that needs performant code

executing within 30ms that's not terrible

damn... this will be hard... I know looking at a picture that it's blurry but what makes it blurry... it's the softness, lack of contours
