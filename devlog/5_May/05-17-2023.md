first day at the field what happened?... it failed

Was trying to connect to a wifi network, none, stuck

I brought a keyboard/display but guess what... forgot the hdmi cable great...

so I'm back home now to get that and make this quick edit to turn the wifi check off

ooh man if I had brought my camera's hdmi out thing that I made could have gotten by

I'll bring both now
