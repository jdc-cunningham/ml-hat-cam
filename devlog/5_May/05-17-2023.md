first day at the field what happened?... it failed

Was trying to connect to a wifi network, none, stuck

I brought a keyboard/display but guess what... forgot the hdmi cable great...

so I'm back home now to get that and make this quick edit to turn the wifi check off

ooh man if I had brought my camera's hdmi out thing that I made could have gotten by

I'll bring both now

12:21 PM

oh no my git repo is f'd

ugh..

this

```
error: object file .git/objects/98/680b3e03f26ae169866e39aba621defca419a8 is empty
fatal: loose object 98680b3e03f26ae169866e39aba621defca419a8 (stored in .git/objects/98/680b3e03f26ae169866e39aba621defca419a8) is corrupt
```

fresh clones are iffy since I may be missing stuff

wtf sudo command not found... oh no

oh I was not in the RPi thank goodness

slow clone

I got all setup at the field, had to take it all down haha

I did save a turtle though that was trying to cross the road... real long boy looking like a rolly polly

Might have caught rabis from touching its shell oh well

alright it's working, time to go back out there

7:24 PM

Just watched Guardians of the Galaxy Vol 3 was good... The Flash is looking good, if I'm not homeless in June I gotta see that.

Anyway I have to write some scripts to merge the multiple 10s audio files and also batch run through the h264 to mp4

It's going to suuuuuckkkk I really hope some of this footage is usable since it does not have the autofocus code enabled... I need to do that with a fresh mind one day and rearchitect it all

7:40 PM

ooh man yeah over 300 files

7:57 PM

oh man the footage is out of focus... damnnnnnn

8:00 PM

dang... the plane is barely in frame too for some reason, I wonder if I'm missing footage

8:13 PM

I broke the camera display too sucks

Saturday is looking good, though I prefer to hit up the park on weekdays... in the future though when I have a job again I'll probably only be able to go the park on a weekend anyway

so I should try and get this fixed/do another round this saturday

8:57 PM

I gotta make this video for my Vanta Wing youtube channel

I'm at a sketch part in my life right now where I'm about to be homeless lmao

So I'm not sure how much free time I have/can I shoot for the Saturday time
