first day at the field what happened?... it failed

Was trying to connect to a wifi network, none, stuck

I brought a keyboard/display but guess what... forgot the hdmi cable great...

so I'm back home now to get that and make this quick edit to turn the wifi check off

ooh man if I had brought my camera's hdmi out thing that I made could have gotten by

I'll bring both now

oh no my git repo is f'd

ugh..

this

```
error: object file .git/objects/98/680b3e03f26ae169866e39aba621defca419a8 is empty
fatal: loose object 98680b3e03f26ae169866e39aba621defca419a8 (stored in .git/objects/98/680b3e03f26ae169866e39aba621defca419a8) is corrupt
```

fresh clones are iffy since I may be missing stuff
