Ahh man I woke up way too early for some reason...

Anyway nexus point in life, another tech job or labor

Either way time moves on... I realized since most jobs now are against being remote I won't have the opportunity to visit the park on weekdays/will be gone 9-5 M-F entire days...

So I gotta get this thing working/take it out to the field tomorrow (nice weather)

I fixed the Vortex 3 already, I crashed it again... the radio went dead or something as it just went into a flat dive, I wasn't even that far away or high up so it was odd... I'm thinking the battery I was using was bad?... I need to test them pull 300mA and see if they can sustain it, that's half the current rating of the battery

Things I need to address immediately:

- record to USB
- setup record button
- fixed focus
  - tie to voice command
- fix autofocus

I have a hunch on what to do (take the buffer stream and write to to a file) but not sure how

well it's built into the picamera module

of course in this case it's put into a video stream vs. to file

I probably can write a separate file to do camera recording stuff, although I still need to extract frames to do autofocus... which I want bare minimum, actually use it as a video camera

So just focus on writing to file and photo is in focus (preview on OLED is too much work)

yeap... nice company I left like a dummy, six figs to nothing

8:12 AM

Distracted, saw someone starred a repo of mine, updated readme

The hat cam may die soon since I haven't charged it lately... I can still keep going with a single battery I have on the side while the two main ones charge.

Parallel batteries is cool and each cell is protected

I think there is a pretty good size SD card on the RPi but I'm trying to avoid using it due to shortening its life span

8:20 AM

still distracted... okay write to file

this is a 128GB sd card

`lsblk` shows the 32GB USB drive as `/dev/sda` probably

8:25 AM

hmm... I should find a way to mount the remote volume (RPi) into vscode

so I write code in both places

8:36 AM

lol would think this is obvious but I guess not

OS GUI makes it easy

oh okay it's not bad, need sudo and then the `/mount` path is the actual path you use to write with

looking at this too
