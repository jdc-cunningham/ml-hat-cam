alright alright, fresh new day just for me

12:06 PM

so first thing I'll work on is making the stepper stuff class based

eventually I will have to change the original code/make it faster

it's currently slow which is a good thing so I don't destroy it by moving too far (no physical tracking)

1:44 PM

weird issue where stepper won't change direction, working on zeroing

1:49 PM

I did realize I'll probably have to use threads for this to rotate both rings at the same time

oh I got it was a dumb copy/paste issue

2:07 PM

the camera doesn't always initialize that's a problem, I have to restart the pi

2:23 PM

yeap... there is a fatal flaw with this design, it's the ribbon cable being hard to access

the way this ribbon cable thing works too is annoying like you move one side up, the other side goes down

2:30 PM

I still can't get the camera to go back up ugh
