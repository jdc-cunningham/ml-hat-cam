can't do much tonight, but wanted to try the updates yesterday

11:13 PM

plugged in, can't wait for this thing to be assembled

11:20 PM

of course there's an error I wrote it

11:36 PM

omg this is annoying these imports aren't working

I'm gonna have to write some test code and test imports

11:46 PM

is it this easy

nope...

oh wait dunce boy be clownin

you have 70 years left it's alright

I am concerned about all these self calls...

it is passed down though... should be good?

11:55 PM

so it's working as far as moving and tracking position

I need to try a boot recovery deal

move it manually to some position, then turn it off, back on, next run, resets to 0 from db entry

11:58 PM

yoooooo the position limiting is working, nice

I can't advance beyond the limits

Okay so I set it to 190 tele, 20 focus

12:18 AM

okay that's pretty good, zeroes itself on boot/instantiating steppers
