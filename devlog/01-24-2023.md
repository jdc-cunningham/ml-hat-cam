back on... feeling better today regarding left over energy after work

been eating a lot too

I really want to 3D print something, but usually anything I print takes at least an hour, so gotta get it right otherwise just waste plastic

I'm going to take advantage of these grooves on the moving parts of the lenses as extra things for the gear to slip onto... so it stays straight.

look at how dumb this is lol

I learned how to design like screw pitch and what not like 14-16 years ago but unused.
