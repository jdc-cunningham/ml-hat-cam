Alright got 5 hours let's go

- add sqlite to track the stepper position so it's not lost
- fix overrotation check (ignored by manual calls)

I did get an answer about the GPIO pins... GPIO 1 (pin 28) could be the culprit apparently

I'm distracted but will get some work done

I'm concerned about the read/write speed of sqlite but I doubt I'll notice it

It's in memory right...

I have a cool project in mind too now, it's not fancy but makin a pizero camera with custom rotation grip for the lens and zoom preview.

Will be a neat erognomic design challenge although my modeler does not do smooth surfaces easily (SketchUp)

current learning wall is sqlite, I've used it before but it's not my daily DB

1:31 PM

ugh... I need to write this sqlite code separately before adding it into the stepper code

2:23 PM

I might have to switch to postgres due to the concurrency

Other thing is... I was thinking about the stepper code how each instance has to write to the DB... do you connect per instance or connect higher up and pass the connection down...

2:44 PM

damn time is moving

I'm kind of stuck on this concurrent write thing...

idk it seems silly but no feedback, and slack in the gears/drift... it's not perfect

but I'd like to not have to zero this thing often by tracking the positions

tracking by step seems nuts too you could just write the bulk run after it's done

I'm just gonna try it... I need to thread the steppers still

3:16 PM

I'm losing track of what I'm trying to do

This threading way to write to sqlite seems to be working

it does error every now and then though
