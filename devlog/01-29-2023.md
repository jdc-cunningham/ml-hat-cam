Alright got 5 hours let's go

- add sqlite to track the stepper position so it's not lost
- fix overrotation check (ignored by manual calls)

I did get an answer about the GPIO pins... GPIO 1 (pin 28) could be the culprit apparently

I'm distracted but will get some work done

I'm concerned about the read/write speed of sqlite but I doubt I'll notice it

It's in memory right...

I have a cool project in mind too now, it's not fancy but makin a pizero camera with custom rotation grip for the lens and zoom preview.

Will be a neat erognomic design challenge although my modeler does not do smooth surfaces easily (SketchUp)

current learning wall is sqlite, I've used it before but it's not my daily DB

1:31 PM

ugh... I need to write this sqlite code separately before adding it into the stepper code

2:23 PM

I might have to switch to postgres due to the concurrency

Other thing is... I was thinking about the stepper code how each instance has to write to the DB... do you connect per instance or connect higher up and pass the connection down...
