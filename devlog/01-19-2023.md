I am pretty excited about this project

It's something I see myself personally hoaning and using

I used to film myself flying my planes with a static camera on the ground

It would shoot in 4K and you just see this tiny dot zooming around

This camera only goes up to 50mm so it's not far... but the fact that it tracks... I can get some good footage

But what's exciting is the hardware/software blend.

I have to design the servo (for now) linkages that will deal with the autozoom.

Ideally what I envision is, the setup (going to use Pi 4 for the resources) will have a display.

You would select pretrained model types (standard, delta, flying wing, etc...) OR... you could potentially pre-trace your plane on the ground

Walk around it and "calibrate" but what I imagine happening is you would get some film of the plane without the ML tracking autozoom

Then you would label images later of the plane in different frames and it would learn from that... how to keep the plane 1/3 of the screen size.

You could also use voice commands to say "zoom in/zoom out"

At this point I have orderd the 12MP camera and 8-50mm zoom lens from UCTronics, it's from China so taking a week.

It's not quite time to fly yet and I have to fix my DLG

What will be exciting to fly is my E-Flite F16 80mm EDF... as it is scary to land where I'm at

Anyway yeah this will be a fun project
