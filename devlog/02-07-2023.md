Okay Let me get some work done on this

I ordered a new toy so I need to get more progress done on this before briefly working on that... that one is a ready made device though so I'm not building it.

Also this project will not be abandoned because flying my DLG is like therapy for me it makes me feel at ease, in the moment

something I look forward to as spring/summer nears

last time I decided to mock the steppers so I don't have to set it all up to write code on the windows desktop (my main machine) I was writing code mostly via SSH ib the pi and that was slow
