ya boi gots an idea

use a thread to do the frame processing separate from the frame buffer stream/write

also I'm going to work out this algo separately

12:22 PM

distracted, back on

12:28 PM

man I suck at algos, that's why leetcode is generally not my thing

- you start at a neutral focus set by human
- it gets out of focus why? more than likely you moved towards something
  - focus in (near)
    - better
      - try again
        - continue
      - stop best found
    - worse
      - try other direction
        - better
          - try again
            - continue
          - stop best found

so we have two branches, then the same branch in either case but re-using branch direction

I don't know if I need recursion, it's already in a while loop

12:50 PM

ughh man I'm failing, weak brain

```
in_vars = [
  8,
  10,
  12,
  14,
  16
]

out_vars = [
  8,
  6,
  4,
  2,
  0
]

focused_near = False
max_var = 0

def focus_near(i):
  global focused_near
  return in_vars[i]

def focus_far(i):
  global focused_near
  return out_vars[i]


for i in range (0, 5, 1):
  if (max_var == 0):
    cur_var = focus_near(i)
  else:
    if (focused_near):
      cur_var = focus_near(i)
      if (cur_var < max_var):
        focused_near = False
    else:
      cur_var = focus_far(i)

  if (cur_var > max_var):
    max_var = cur_var

print(max_var)
```

12:58 PM

okay... I think I have an algo

- get the first current value
- find which direction increases next values
- find max value, stop

1:18 PM

alright I have this algo now

```
near_vars = [
  8,
  10,
  12,
  14,
  16,
  14,
  12
]

far_vars = [
  8,
  6,
  4,
  2,
  0
]

prev_var = 0
next_var = 0
max_var = 0
dir_near = None

def focus_near(i):
  var = near_vars[i]
  return var

def focus_far(i):
  var = far_vars[i]
  return var

for i in range (0, 7, 1): # frame loop
  # get first sample
  if (prev_var == 0):
    prev_var = focus_near(i)
    max_var = prev_var
    continue

  # get second sample
  if (next_var == 0):
    next_var = focus_near(i)

    if (next_var > max_var):
      max_var = next_var
      continue
  else: # decide direction to keep going
    if (next_var > prev_var):
      dir_near = True
    else:
      dir_near = False

  if (dir_near):
    cur_var = focus_near(i)
  else:
    cur_var = focus_far(i)
  
  # find max value and stop
  if (cur_var):
    if (cur_var > max_var):
      max_var = cur_var
    elif (cur_var <= max_var):
      break
```

Still verbose and nasty

the for loop is a mock of the while loop from the streaming frames

the stopping is interesting because it changes so it'll have to recognize to start going again

1:28 PM

oh damn, forgot when you rotate the lens, you have to wait for the next loop to get new frame
