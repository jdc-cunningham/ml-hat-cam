ooh... energy and in a better mood today

I did not form an intuition yesterday on the zooming stuff... will rewatch some footage.

5:31 PM

so it looks like a neutral forward zoom is at 340 steps or nearly 100% focused (far)

as you zoom in you can back off the focus (wide)

so I can do that, set zoom to 0 and focus at 340 on init

5:37 PM

cool that's a good starting point

then I want to sample a frame from the video stream, the video stream would normally be saving into a USB drive or currenlty streaming... but I don't know how to get a frame right now
