ooh... energy and in a better mood today

I did not form an intuition yesterday on the zooming stuff... will rewatch some footage.

5:31 PM

so it looks like a neutral forward zoom is at 340 steps or nearly 100% focused (far)

as you zoom in you can back off the focus (wide)

so I can do that, set zoom to 0 and focus at 340 on init

5:37 PM

cool that's a good starting point

then I want to sample a frame from the video stream, the video stream would normally be saving into a USB drive or currenlty streaming... but I don't know how to get a frame right now

5:42 PM

here's a sample rate in the `self.wfile.write(frame)` call

```
1676072521.4183776
1676072521.451728
1676072521.485261
1676072521.518524
1676072521.551656
1676072521.5850217
1676072521.6181655
1676072521.6515002
1676072521.6850586
```

So it looks like you get 3 hits per second... that's like 300ms delay damn

Although... well does this mean 3fps... that doesn't seem right

here's a full second dump

that's 30FPS great

I need to pull one out and store it as a local image

oh damn I gotta stop this, writing to SD card over and over kill its quick

I think I shouldn't store it locally, but keep it in memory and then iterate over the pixels.

5:58 PM

nice I got a frame saved, now I have to keep it in memory but can start analyzing it

6:07 PM

oh yeah... I forgot about canny edge detection I can use that...

how do I count edges... len ha 400 sounds like a lot but it's not

ooh on a decacore i9 it takes 6ms to do canny edge on a 640x400 image

each frame above for streaming takes 30ms

this could work

My thought is if an image is blurry you have less edges... right?

so let me try one that's worse and run the edge count

what... it found none but len still says 475 hmm

wow... this is not simple

https://stackoverflow.com/questions/54889712/gradient-of-edges-python

wtf is this... looking at `edges[0]` output it's a massive dump of 0 or 255

635 values for one

I think this is where the boolean matrix comes in, dump all the 0's and count the 255's

edges is an ndarray

ooh... this will work

oh wait.. it's the width of the image... and then the height is the parent loop oh...

naruhodo

that's where teh 475x635 comes from huh

yeah that's the dimensions of my images I see

whoa... I might have something

I need to make a closed loop thing now that uses this to sample the frame and then I cna move a target away/towards the camera and it should autozoom

I could be completely wrong idk but the blurry hypothesis seems right

6:31 PM

I can do a basic test before wiring it up to the steppers... just log what direction to go or at least if it's blurry or more clear

6:43 PM

oh damn it's struggling lol

but the theory works... about blurry = no edges...

6:48 PM

right now I have it at widest zoom so it doesn't see the hand change... I'll adjust it so it has a lower aperture/narrower depth of field

processing is at 18ms per frame with lag

if it's using far zoom, doesn't have to scan every frame
