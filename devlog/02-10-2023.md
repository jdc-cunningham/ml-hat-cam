ooh... energy and in a better mood today

I did not form an intuition yesterday on the zooming stuff... will rewatch some footage.

5:31 PM

so it looks like a neutral forward zoom is at 340 steps or nearly 100% focused (far)

as you zoom in you can back off the focus (wide)

so I can do that, set zoom to 0 and focus at 340 on init

5:37 PM

cool that's a good starting point

then I want to sample a frame from the video stream, the video stream would normally be saving into a USB drive or currenlty streaming... but I don't know how to get a frame right now

5:42 PM

here's a sample rate in the `self.wfile.write(frame)` call

```
1676072521.4183776
1676072521.451728
1676072521.485261
1676072521.518524
1676072521.551656
1676072521.5850217
1676072521.6181655
1676072521.6515002
1676072521.6850586
```

So it looks like you get 3 hits per second... that's like 300ms delay damn

Although... well does this mean 3fps... that doesn't seem right

here's a full second dump

```
1676072521.0185652

1676072521.6181655
1676072521.6515002
1676072521.6850586
1676072521.7182066
1676072521.751426
1676072521.7849603
1676072521.8178256
1676072521.8514907
1676072521.8846617
1676072521.918238
1676072521.951266
1676072521.9848313
```

that's 30FPS great

I need to pull one out and store it as a local image

oh damn I gotta stop this, writing to SD card over and over kill its quick

I think I shouldn't store it locally, but keep it in memory and then iterate over the pixels.
