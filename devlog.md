Not writing code for this today but I'm going to get this functional/get some usable video.

This will be my last whole free week. The week after that I think I'll be applying to Amazon FC.

I need to start receiving money again middle of next month. I'm working on my finance SaaS app on the side too but that's brand new.

I'm going to fix the autofocus, bridge all the parts together so it just works and uses voice command.

Then I'll get the video. I put some glue on the tail today.

I may wait another week though (2 weeks off) to get the Pinetab 2 ARM from the shipping place.

Hopefully that gets shipped out... then I don't have to worry about having time.

I sold my 3080 Ti FE ahhh.... $400 loss damn.

Oh well... just things
